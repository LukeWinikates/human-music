Streaming Music Library Management for Quiet Humans

Finding music you already like is weirdly hard in most streaming music apps. Searching by artist typically means going through an alphabetized list of hundreds of names, with tiny touch targets.

The purpose of *Human Music* is:

* a library-focused approach
* that surfaces favorites easily
* that gives a modern, touch-based flavor of the tactile enjoyment associated with physical media like vinyl
* that integrates with content from streaming services and plays to AirPlay speakers
* that supports building thematic playlists and play sessions
* that doesn't push new music at you, but provides it if you're looking for it
